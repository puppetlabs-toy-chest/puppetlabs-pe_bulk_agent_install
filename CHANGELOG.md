# Changelog

## Release 1.0.1

### Summary

This is a minor maintenance release; there are no functional changes to any of the code. The GitHub URL has changed from puppet to puppetlabs, so the `metadata.json` file needed updating as well.

## Release 1.0.0

### Summary

This is the first publically available release. It provides intial implementations for bulk installing Puppet Agents on POSIX (EL and Debian) and Windows hosts.
